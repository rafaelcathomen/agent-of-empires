# agent-chat

Inter-agent messaging for the [aoe](https://www.agent-of-empires.com/) fleet. One
agent asks another (addressed by its aoe session title or id) a question and gets a
reply back, even though each agent is an independent, long-lived Claude session in its
own repo/worktree.

## Why

aoe sessions already share an async blackboard (`aoe context`), but there was no way to
ask a *specific* agent a question and get an answer within your turn. The hard part
isn't storage; it's the **wakeup**: an idle Claude agent only acts when given a turn.
`agent-chat` uses a shared SQLite store for messages and `aoe send` as the **doorbell**
that injects a turn into the recipient so it actually sees the question and replies.

## Install

```bash
ln -sf /path/to/agent-chat/agent-chat ~/.local/bin/agent-chat   # ~/.local/bin must be on PATH
```

For **hands-free** operation (agents replying without a permission prompt), each machine
also needs two one-time entries under `~/.claude/`:

1. Allow the command, in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   { "permissions": { "allow": ["Bash(agent-chat:*)"] } }
   ```
   Without it, Claude Code's auto-mode classifier blocks `agent-chat reply` as an
   external write and the recipient stalls at a prompt.
2. Tell agents to honor incoming messages, append to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:
   > If you receive a message beginning with `[agent-chat]`, it's another agent asking
   > you a question, answer it by running the `agent-chat reply ...` command it shows.

3. *(optional, recommended)* Let Claude Code agents **auto-discover** the tool from
   natural language ("ask the data-pipeline agent ...") instead of having to know the
   command. Add a skill at `~/.claude/skills/talk-to-agent/SKILL.md` whose `description`
   triggers on phrasings like *"ask/tell/talk to &lt;agent&gt;"*, *"consult another agent"*,
   *"poll a group"*, and whose body points the agent at `agent-chat ask "<addr>" "<q>"`
   and `agent-chat broadcast "<folder>" "<q>"`. Without it, agents can still run
   `agent-chat` directly.

## Use

```bash
# Ask another agent (blocks, polling, up to --timeout seconds):
agent-chat ask "data-pipeline" "which schema version did you settle on?"
agent-chat ask "work/agile/newton" "..."   # full folder path (disambiguates duplicate titles)

# Ask EVERY agent under a folder/group, concurrently (fleet fan-out):
agent-chat broadcast "work/agile" "what's your current blocker?"

# On the recipient side (the doorbell tells it exactly this):
agent-chat inbox                       # list open questions for me
agent-chat reply <msg_id> "v3, after the migration"

# Retrieve a reply that arrived after a timeout:
agent-chat replies

# Inspect a conversation:
agent-chat thread <thread_id>
agent-chat whoami
```

If a reply arrives while you're still blocking in `ask`, it returns immediately. If you
time out first, the reply is delivered later via an `aoe send` doorbell (and is always
retrievable with `agent-chat replies`).

## Scripting / automated askers

For headless or automated callers (e.g. the aoe group-context curator):

```bash
agent-chat ask "<id>" "<q>" --json --no-revive --timeout 60
```

- `--json` prints one object: `{"status": ..., "msg_id", "thread_id", "reply", and on
  success "reply_id"+"from"}`. `status` is `answered` | `pending` | `skipped`.
- `--no-revive` never wakes a *stopped* recipient; it returns `skipped` immediately
  instead of reviving it (no compute spun up). Live/idle recipients are unaffected.
- **Exit codes:** `0` answered · `3` no answer (`pending` timed out, or `skipped`) ·
  `1` error (e.g. unknown recipient). Don't sniff stdout; branch on the exit code or
  the `status` field.

Headless callers must set `AGENT_CHAT_ID='id:title'` (auto-detect needs a live aoe
session). A headless one-shot can *ask* but cannot *receive*; recipients must be live
interactive aoe sessions.

## How it works

- **Store**: one SQLite DB (WAL) at `$AGENT_CHAT_DB` or `~/.local/share/agent-chat/mail.db`.
- **Identity**: `aoe session current` (override with `$AGENT_CHAT_ID='id:title'` or `--from`).
- **Addressing**: recipients resolved against `aoe list`; pass a title, id, id-prefix,
  an explicit `id:title`, or a **full folder path** `group/sub/title` (a bare title that
  collides across folders errors and lists the candidates).
- **Broadcast**: `broadcast <folder-path>` resolves the folder subtree and asks every
  agent in it concurrently (wall-clock = slowest reply, not the sum), excluding self.
- **Doorbell**: `aoe send <recipient> "..."` wakes an idle/stopped session
  (auto-revives). The doorbell text is self-describing, so recipients need no prior
  knowledge of the protocol (see Install for the one-time permission rule).

## Test

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Tests run without an aoe daemon (identities via `--from`, recipients via `id:title`,
`--no-doorbell` to skip `aoe send`).

## Limitations / future

- For rich threads, search, or file reservations, the upgrade path is
  [MCP Agent Mail](https://mcpagentmail.com/).

## Fork additions (rafaelcathomen)

This fork adds two things on top of upstream, keeping the SQLite + doorbell spine:

- **Folder-path addressing**: resolve recipients by `group/sub/title`, with
  cross-folder ambiguity refusal (upstream resolves by title/id only).
- **`broadcast`**: concurrent group fan-out to a whole folder subtree.

Both reuse upstream's `aoe send` doorbell and store-backed reply; no screen-scraping.
