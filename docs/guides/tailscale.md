# Tailscale Setup

Set up Tailscale from scratch so you can reach your AOE TUI and web dashboard from any device on your tailnet: phone, tablet, or another computer.

Once set up, `aoe serve --remote --passphrase <your-passphrase>` gives you a stable `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net` URL via Funnel. No domain, no Cloudflare account, no rotating URLs. The PWA survives restarts, and traffic is end-to-end encrypted.

For the end-to-end phone setup after Tailscale is working, see [Remote Access from Your Phone](remote-phone-access.md). For the full `aoe serve` reference, see [Web Dashboard](web-dashboard.md).

## Why Tailscale for AOE

- **Stable URL.** Your dashboard lives at `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net`, the same URL across restarts, so an installed PWA keeps working. (Cloudflare quick tunnels rotate the URL on every restart, breaking installed PWAs.)
- **End-to-end encrypted.** Tailscale encrypts traffic between your phone and your host with WireGuard. Funnel adds a TLS certificate served from the node itself, so the browser sees a valid HTTPS connection, no self-signed certificate warnings.
- **No domain required.** Your tailnet name is your domain. No registrar, no DNS records, no Cloudflare account.
- **Free.** Tailscale's free Personal plan covers up to 6 users. Funnel is included at no extra cost.

## Install Tailscale

1. Download and install from [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download). **Tailscale 1.52+ is required** (aoe uses the single-command Funnel syntax introduced in 1.52). Packages are available for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android.
2. Log in:
   ```bash
   tailscale up
   ```
   This opens a browser window for authentication. After login, your node joins the tailnet.
3. Verify the node is connected:
   ```bash
   tailscale status
   ```
   Your node should appear with its hostname, tailnet IP (`100.x.y.z`), and status `active`.

The Tailscale daemon runs as a background service: on macOS via launchd, on Linux via systemd, on Windows via the system tray app. You don't need to keep a terminal open.

## Enable Funnel

Funnel exposes your node to the public internet through Tailscale's Funnel relay servers. It's a per-tailnet feature that must be enabled once:

1. Go to [login.tailscale.com/f/funnel](https://login.tailscale.com/f/funnel).
2. Click **Enable Funnel**.
3. Accept the terms.

This is a one-time global switch. Without it, `tailscale funnel` fails with "Funnel is not enabled for this tailnet"; aoe detects this in seconds and shows the fix inline.

## Grant Funnel permission in your ACL

Funnel needs explicit permission per node. Open your ACL at [login.tailscale.com/admin/acls/file](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls/file) and add a `nodeAttrs` block:

**For personal tailnets** (most users):

```jsonc
"nodeAttrs": [
  {
    "target": ["autogroup:member"],
    "attr":   ["funnel"],
  },
],
```

This grants the `funnel` attribute to every device owned by a tailnet member. It's the simplest option and works for the vast majority of setups.

**If your node is tagged**, `autogroup:member` does not apply to tagged nodes. Target the tag instead:

```jsonc
"nodeAttrs": [
  {
    "target": ["tag:my-server"],
    "attr":   ["funnel"],
  },
],
```

Or use `"*"` to cover every node on the tailnet, tagged or not.

Save the ACL. Changes take effect immediately. aoe re-checks the node on the Confirm screen; press `R` to refresh.

## Run AOE

Once Tailscale is installed and logged in, you can reach AOE in three ways. The first requires Funnel and ACL; the other two only need Tailscale.

### Web Dashboard over Funnel (recommended for phones)

```bash
aoe serve --remote --passphrase <your-passphrase>
```

`--remote` requires a passphrase: add `--passphrase <value>` or set `AOE_SERVE_PASSPHRASE`. The TUI prompt handles this for you automatically; from the CLI you must supply it.

aoe detects `tailscale` on `PATH` and spins up `tailscale funnel --bg --yes <port>` automatically. First-time HTTPS certificate provisioning can take 30-60 seconds; the startup isn't stuck. A QR code appears on the TUI; scan it with your phone. The dashboard is available at `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net`.

Add `--read-only` to monitor without terminal input: `aoe serve --remote --read-only --passphrase <...>`.

The tunnel config persists in Tailscale's daemon across `aoe serve --stop` and restarts, so the URL stays live. If you pass `--tunnel-name`, that takes precedence over Tailscale auto-detection.

**Port 443 conflicts.** If a non-loopback Funnel service already uses port 443 on this node, aoe refuses to start rather than replace it. A stale loopback config from a prior aoe run is overwritten cleanly. The Error dialog offers `[R]` to run `tailscale funnel reset`. Note: `tailscale funnel reset` clears all Funnel configuration on this node, including any other Funnel services you may have set up. Run `tailscale funnel status` first to check. Or pass `--no-tailscale` to fall back to Cloudflare.

For the full phone setup (PWA install, security model, push notifications), see [Remote Access from Your Phone](remote-phone-access.md).

### Web Dashboard over tailnet IP (no Funnel)

If you don't need public internet access, bind the dashboard to all interfaces and reach it directly over the tailnet:

```bash
aoe serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

Then open `http://<tailnet-ip>:8080` (e.g. `http://100.68.123.45:8080`) from any device on your tailnet. The tailnet IP is the `100.x.y.z` address shown in `tailscale status`. The tailnet IP works with no extra flag (the DNS-rebinding gate trusts IP literals, which cannot be rebound); only reaching the box by its MagicDNS **name** (`<machine>.tailnet.ts.net`) needs `--allowed-host <name>`.

This keeps traffic entirely inside the WireGuard mesh: no Funnel, no public exposure, no TLS certificate needed. Tailscale encrypts the connection end-to-end. Use this when you only need access from your own devices on the same tailnet.

### TUI over Tailscale SSH

Tailscale includes a built-in SSH server that lets you connect to your host over the tailnet, no port forwarding, no public IP, no `sshd` config needed. The SSH server runs on Linux and macOS (open-source CLI); Windows, iOS, and Android can connect as clients but cannot host the SSH server.

**Enable Tailscale SSH** on the host:

```bash
tailscale up --ssh
```

This is a one-time flag. You can also enable it from the admin console at [login.tailscale.com/admin/machines](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) by checking the SSH box for your node. Tailscale SSH listens on port 22 and cannot be changed.

**Connect from any device on the tailnet:**

```bash
ssh <user>@<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net
```

Or use the Tailscale IP (`100.x.y.z` from `tailscale status`):

```bash
ssh <user>@100.x.y.z
```

If MagicDNS and Tailscale SSH are both enabled, you can also use the shorter `tailscale ssh` wrapper:

```bash
tailscale ssh <user>@<machine>
```

Once connected, you have a few options:

- **Start a new AOE session:**
  ```bash
  aoe
  ```
  Launches the TUI in a fresh tmux session. Your work is safe even if the SSH connection drops; tmux keeps it running server-side.

- **Attach to an existing AOE session.** If `aoe` is already running on the host (e.g. you started it locally and closed the terminal), attach to its tmux session:
  ```bash
  tmux ls
  ```
  AOE sessions are named `aoe_<title>_<id>` (e.g. `aoe_my-session_a1b2c3d4`). Attach to one:
  ```bash
  tmux attach -t aoe_<session-title>_<session-id>
  ```
  This reconnects you to the same session list, agent terminals, and in-progress work.

- **List active agents** without attaching:
  ```bash
  aoe list
  ```

No public tunnel, no QR code, no passphrase; the TUI runs over the encrypted WireGuard connection. Tailscale SSH authenticates via your tailnet identity, so you don't need to manage SSH keys or passwords separately.

**Tagged node note.** If your host is tagged, Tailscale SSH may be disabled by default. Add a `ssh` action to your ACL:

```jsonc
"ssh": [
  {
    "action": "accept",
    "src":    ["autogroup:member"],
    "dst":    ["tag:my-server"],
    "users":  ["autogroup:nonroot"],
  },
],
```

See [Tailscale's SSH documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh) for details.

## When to use Cloudflare instead

Tailscale is the recommended transport for most users. Consider Cloudflare instead if you can't install Tailscale, or if you already have a Cloudflare domain and a named tunnel (`cloudflared tunnel create`). See [Web Dashboard](web-dashboard.md) for Cloudflare setup instructions.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Funnel not enabled for this node" (on the Confirm screen)**: your ACL is missing the `funnel` nodeAttr. This is detected pre-flight at the transport assessment step. If your node is tagged, `autogroup:member` rules don't apply to it; target the tag directly, or use `"*"`. Save the ACL and press `R` on the Confirm screen to re-check.

- **"Tailscale Funnel is not enabled for this tailnet" (at runtime)**: the tailnet-wide Funnel toggle is off. This is detected when `tailscale funnel` actually runs (not at the pre-flight check). Go to [login.tailscale.com/f/funnel](https://login.tailscale.com/f/funnel), flip the switch, then re-run `aoe serve --remote`. The `[R]` key on the Error dialog runs `tailscale funnel reset` here, which won't fix the toggle; you need to relaunch.

- **"port 443 is already configured on this node"**: another non-loopback Funnel service is using port 443. Press `[R]` on the Error dialog to run `tailscale funnel reset`, then retry. Or pass `--no-tailscale` to use Cloudflare instead.

- **`tailscale status` shows the node is offline**: run `tailscale up` on the host. If the node is behind a restrictive firewall, check the admin console at [login.tailscale.com/admin/machines](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines). Tailscale uses DERP relays to punch through most NATs, so outright offline is rare.

- **`tailscale` not found on PATH**: install from [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download) and make sure the daemon is running. On Linux, `systemctl status tailscaled`. On macOS, the menu bar app registers a launchd daemon. On Windows, check the system tray.

- **SSH connection refused**: Tailscale SSH is not enabled on the host. Run `tailscale up --ssh` or enable it in the admin console. If the node is tagged, make sure the ACL has a `ssh` rule targeting the tag.

- **Funnel URL works on the tailnet but not from the internet**: Funnel exposes the node to the public internet via DERP relays. Confirm the tailnet-wide Funnel toggle is on at [login.tailscale.com/f/funnel](https://login.tailscale.com/f/funnel) and the node has the `funnel` attr.

- **PWA stopped working after aoe restart**: you were on a Cloudflare quick tunnel. Switch to Tailscale (the default when `tailscale` is on PATH), delete the installed PWA, and reinstall from the new stable URL. See [Remote Access from Your Phone](remote-phone-access.md) for PWA install instructions.
