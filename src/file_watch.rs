/// the same string), and on ext4/overlayfs the freed inode number is
/// routinely recycled by the immediate recreate, so `(dev, ino)` alone
/// is insufficient; the identity also carries the birth time
/// (`fs::Metadata::created`, statx btime on Linux), which a recycled
/// inode cannot reproduce. On filesystems without btime the third
/// component is `None` on both sides and the comparison degrades to
/// `(dev, ino)`, leaving the residual hazard only where no-btime and
/// inode recycling coincide. On non-Unix platforms `WatchIdentity` is
/// `()`, so identity comparisons trivially match and the watch-install
