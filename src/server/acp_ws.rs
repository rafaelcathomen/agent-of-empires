//! Acp WebSocket fanout.
//!
//! `/sessions/{id}/acp/ws` upgrades to a WebSocket that subscribes
//! to `AppState::acp_events_tx` and forwards every frame whose
//! `session_id` matches the route param. Frames are JSON. The protocol
//! is one-way today (server -> client); inbound messages are ignored.
//!
//! Durability lives in `AppState::acp_event_store` (SQLite), not
//! this channel. The broadcast channel is best-effort: a client that
//! connects between a `tx.send` and its `subscribe()` misses frames,
//! and `RecvError::Lagged` drops frames when the channel overflows.
//! Both cases recover via the on-connect drain, which reads the
//! event store from `?since=` (or 0 for fresh subscribers); the
//! same store backs `GET /api/sessions/{id}/acp/replay`. The
//! channel is the fast path; the store is the truth.
