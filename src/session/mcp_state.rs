//! Drift store for the unified MCP surface (#1996).
//!
//! AoE keeps no live daemon state for MCP servers, so "what AoE last knew about
//! a server" must be persisted. `<app_dir>/mcp_state.json` records, per agent,
//! the last-seen definition of every server read from that agent's native
//! config. On each surface open, the current native config is reconciled against
//! this snapshot to detect drift:
//!
//! - a server whose definition CHANGED since the snapshot is a conflict the user
//!   resolves (feature C);
//! - a server that DISAPPEARED from the native config is kept in AoE's view and
//!   flagged (keep-on-removal, feature D), rather than silently dropped;
//! - a server that is NEW (present in native, absent from the snapshot) is
//!   adopted silently and recorded, so a first-ever open raises zero conflicts.
//!
//! The store holds the FULL, unredacted definition (env and header values
//! included): keep-on-removal and "AoE wins" must be able to reconstruct a
//! working server, which a redacted snapshot or a bare fingerprint cannot. The
//! file therefore carries the same secrets the user already keeps in plaintext
//! in `mcp.json` and the agents' own configs; it is written owner-only and
//! redacted at every DISPLAY edge (see [`super::mcp_model::RedactedMcpServer`]),
//! never on disk. AoE writes only this store and its own `mcp.json`; it never
//! writes back to an agent-native config (sync is native -> AoE only).
//!
//! Concurrent surface opens serialize through an exclusive file lock, mirroring
//! the repo trust store (`repo_config::trust_repo`).
