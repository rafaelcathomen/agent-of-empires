//! Shared test-support helpers.
//!
//! Tests across the crate need to point `HOME` (and, on Linux/macOS,
//! `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` plus `XDG_DATA_HOME`) at an isolated temporary
//! directory so both the crate's dot-dir resolution and the opencode
//! data-dir lookup land in a scratch location instead of the caller's
//! real dirs. Returning a bare `TempDir` from the old duplicated
//! `isolate_app_dir` helpers meant the tempdir was cleaned up on drop,
//! but the env vars leaked into the process for the rest of the test
//! run, poisoning any later test that read them. See issue #2306.
//!
//! [`EnvGuard`] is the one helper every test reaches for when it needs
//! to shim an env var: it snapshots the previous values, so its `Drop`
//! closes the leak by restoring them to their prior state (or removing
//! them if they were previously unset) even if the test panics. It
//! snapshots `OsString` via `env::var_os` rather than `String` via
//! `env::var`, so a non-UTF-8 prior value round-trips faithfully
//! instead of coercing to `None` and being removed (issue #2751).
//!
//! [`AppDirGuard`] layers tempdir ownership on top of an inner
//! `EnvGuard`; issue #2716 folded the per-agent `StorageHomeGuard` /
//! `VibeHomeGuard` / `GeminiHomeGuard` / `ClaudeHomeGuard` /
//! `CodexHomeGuard` copies scattered across the crate into it.
//!
//! Two constructors are offered. [`isolate_app_dir`] creates and owns
//! a fresh tempdir; reach for it when the caller has no directory to
//! share. [`isolate_app_dir_at`] takes a caller-owned
//! [`std::path::Path`] and leaves tempdir lifetime management to the
//! caller; reach for it when a struct or helper already owns a
//! `TempDir` and needs the guard to co-exist with it. When the guard
//! does not own the tempdir, the caller must declare the `TempDir`
//! AFTER the guard in the enclosing struct so field drop order runs
//! env-restore before tempdir cleanup.
//!
//! Scope: the guard isolates tests on Linux and macOS (the crate's
//! supported native targets; Windows is WSL2-only per the README). On
//! native Windows `dirs::home_dir()` resolves via
//! `SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_Profile)`, not `$HOME`, so a
//! `set_var("HOME", ...)` alone would not redirect
//! `get_app_dir_path`. Isolating tests on native Windows would need a
//! different mechanism (e.g. a stub for the profile-folder lookup)
//! rather than more env vars in this snapshot set.
