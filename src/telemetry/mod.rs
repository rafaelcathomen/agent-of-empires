//! Anonymous, opt-in usage telemetry.
//!
//! Design constraints (see issue #1762):
//! - **Off by default.** Nothing is sent unless the user opts in via
//!   [`crate::session::TelemetryConfig::enabled`] in any settings surface.
//! - **`DO_NOT_TRACK` is absolute.** When set (`1` / `true` / `yes`), it
//!   suppresses both sending and install-id generation regardless of config.
//! - **Endpoint.** Opted-in sends go to the collection gateway at
//!   `DEFAULT_ENDPOINT` (which validates and re-sanitizes as a backstop);
//!   `AOE_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` overrides it, e.g. to point at a local sink. A
//!   compiled-in `TELEMETRY_KEY` is sent as `X-Telemetry-Key` so the gateway
//!   can shed drive-by noise (it is visible in source, so not real auth).
//! - **Fire-and-forget.** Sends run detached with a hard timeout (plus a short
//!   connect timeout so a down endpoint fails fast) and swallow every error
//!   (logged only at `debug`, `target: "telemetry"`). Telemetry must never
//!   slow, stall, or crash the tool.
//! - **Sanitized.** No content ever leaves [`sanitize`]: agent/model strings
//!   are coerced to a closed allowlist; raw commands, paths, titles, branch
//!   names, and prompts are never emitted.
