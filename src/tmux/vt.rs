//! Shared in-process VT channel.
//!
//! A `tmux pipe-pane -IO` stream feeds a pane's raw output into an in-process
//! [`vt100::Parser`] (a real grid: alt-screen buffer, cursor, mouse/DEC modes),
//! and the same full-duplex unix socket carries keystroke bytes back to the
//! pane. tmux still owns the pane (process, persistence, kill-tree); only the
//! live render/input transport lives here.
//!
//! One [`VtChannel`] per tmux session, shared and refcounted: every viewer (the
//! native TUI live preview and the web/mobile live terminal) holds an `Arc`, so
//! a session is parsed once no matter how many surfaces watch it. The channel
//! tears down (disables the pipe, stops the forwarder) when the last `Arc`
//! drops. Unix-only; the whole module is `#[cfg(unix)]`.
