//! Graceful-degradation integration test for `AOE_FILE_WATCH=off`.
//!
//! With `AOE_FILE_WATCH=off`, `agent_of_empires::file_watch::test_support::new_filewatch()` must return the
//! noop fallback. Subscribers register but never receive events: the
//! dispatcher does not exist, the drain thread does not exist, and the
//! receiver returned by `subscribe_channel` is paired with a dropped
//! sender so `recv()` resolves to `None` immediately.
//!
//! `#[serial]` because we mutate the `AOE_FILE_WATCH` env var; running
//! in parallel with other env-touching tests would race.
